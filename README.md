There are 6 columns:

- ___job created___ column as timestamp in `%y%m%d-%H%M%S` format
  - orange for pending jobs
  - yellow for running jobs
  - green for successfully completed jobs
  - red for failed jobs
- ___combined "job started" and "job finished"___ column, each as 3-digit value in "minutes since job creation" and "minutes since job start" in `NNNÂ·NNN` format
- ___git reference___ column, limited to 10 chars
- ___commit hash___ column, short form
- ___commit message___ column, first line only and limited to 52 chars
- ___author___ column, limited to 16 chars

And this is what it looks like with pending and running jobs.
